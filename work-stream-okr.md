# Work Stream OKR
## Objective
What is an objective? In its simplest form, it's what you'd like to achieve in the Work Stream.

Generally when I write Objectives for a Work Stream, I find that it's helpful to provide contextual history to the readers. The history helps level-set all readers to the same problem domain before diving into the Objective. There might be occasions where it might seem useless to provide contextual history, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. When in doubt, I always err on side of more context, and information.

The Objective defines the purpose, and the goal of the Work Stream. This section isn't the best place to define the finer details of a Work Stream, think in broader strokes.

Think of an objectives like getting directions for a road trip from a mapping service like Apple Maps or Google Maps, the directions provided mark the starting point, destination, and the route. These types of services don't prescribe when to stop to stretch your legs, where to break for a meals, and when + where to take restroom breaks. They simply provide directions to get you from point `A` to point `B`. Treat Objectives like the route, Objectives are directions to help you get from one point to another, they do not include the finer details.

## Key Results
If Objectives are the broad stokes, think of Key Results as the finer strokes. Key Results define the success of the Work Stream.

Going back to our road trip analogy, Key Results could be:
- Arrive at destination before 4pm local time
- Arrive with at lease a 50% charge on your vehicle
- Don't get a speeding ticket

As you can see, Key Results are measurable goals of the Work Stream. Key Results are not the implementation details of a Work Steam, and should not be used as such.

## Designs
Designs will vary based on the Work Stream. For software products, a design might include a user journey and/or UI/UX mocks.

For a platform engineering project, a design might include a network topography, or a flow digram of an CI/CD strategy.

Designs serve as a visual aid, and I find them an invaluable tool to help build consensus around a Work Stream. I've often experienced meetings where participants think they are all discussing the same topic, but in reality they are all discussing different topics that happen to share the same subject. Designs help level-set a conversation, and provide concrete visuals to rally a conversation.

## Risks
In my experience, Risks are not discussed enough. The excitement of a Work Stream can leave a team unaware of their blindspots, and the associated risks. Surfacing risks associated with a Work Stream early in the process can increase the chances of success. In my experience, I've found that defining Risks shed light on Key Results that might have been missed.

The fact that risks exist is no reason to stop a Work Stream, but they should be leverage to help initiate healthy discussions. The goal of this section is to try to uncover a many of the unknowns as early as possible.

## Open Questions
This section provides the author (or reader) of the Work Stream an outlet to ask questions. Generally these questions need more clarification from stakeholders, cross-functional member, the business unit, etc. Again, the goal of this section is to encourage open discussion about the Work Stream, and discover a many of the unknowns ahead of time. Typically, questions that are answered turn into new Key Results.
